# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL. 
The goal is to explore customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends to guide business decision-making.


## 🧰 Tools Used
- MySQL (Database & SQL queries)


## 🧹 Data Cleaning Summary
- All `NULL` values in critical fields were removed.
- Fixed column name `quantiy` → `quantity`.
- Columns were correctly casted (e.g., `sale_date` as `DATE`, `sale_time` as `TIME`).
